# SQL-Assignment

Here for this second assignment using SQL we used the datasets 'create-databases' script and the 'workddb' script to import and allow querying of data, we answered questions based on what certain things were such as the 'using order by, limit- what country has the highest life expectancy?' as well as writing a query to 'find out the name of the product with the most ammount in stock'
this along with creating EER digrams to show the relationship between each section and collection of data and a relative mapping of the schema itself, we then added all of this into a word document which is presented here.
